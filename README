acts_as_thumbwebs_subscriber plugin
=========

Introduction

#### WARNING NOTE:  ####################################################################### 
We are in beta and the website is in sandbox mode so no money changes hands at this time but everything should be close to working as it will be in production.  However, the site may be unavailable and unstable at times.  Subscriptions can be purchased and your Amazon.com sandbox merchant account will be credited on Amazon.com FPS sandbox.

Subscriptions will be renewed according to license parameters.  So go ahead and set up your channel and issue licenses and test it out.
###########################################################################################

Using this plugin you can make your Ruby on Rails application a membership based website within 15 minutes.

This plugin integrates any Ruby on Rails application with Thumbwebs.com and Amazon FPS.

Thumbwebs.com is a membership based site.  Thumbwebs.com uses Amazon FPS to allow a Rails website to 
sell time-based subscriptions to protected parts of the site.  Thumbwebs.com handles the backend automatically by handling the renewal of subscriptions.

A member of your site can buy a subscription to your thumbweb on thumbwebs.com that gives the member one hour, one day, one week or one month access to protected parts of your site.  The subscription can be renewed automatically each time period as provided for in the license.

You are paid directly and immediately by Amazon.com on purchased subscriptions.  Thumbwebs.com handles the backend on a commission basis.  

Thumbwebs.com comes prepackaged with articles, blogs, video, audio, forum, newsletters and ebook features.  Your site can instantly start selling membership based access to the protected parts of your site and/or integrate the prepackaged features within your site.

Audio, video and pdfs medias can be uploaded to Amazon S3 and signed urls created limiting access to the media.


FEATURES:


Makes available acts_as_thumbwebs_subscriber to your User Model

acts_as_thumbwebs adds the method is_thumbwebs_subscriber? to your User model

The plugin makes available the following before_filter method:

before_filter :thumbwebs_subscription_required 

to your controllers.  Use this to protect index and show methods in your controllers.

The plugin uses activeresource to call thumbwebs.com to check to see if user has an active subscription to your site.

The plugin uses activeresource to prepackage your site with your videos, audios, pdfs, newsletters and forums all of which can be protected by requiring an active subscription.

The plugin uses the following path on your site: 

/thumbwebs

This will give access to the prepackaged articles, videos, audios, ebooks, newsletters, forums models that will be available for subscriptions.


Examples
=======

To enable subscription features in your User model add the following to your user model:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#################################
acts_as_thumbwebs_subscriber    #
#################################
The above will add the method "is_thumbwebs_subscriber?" to your model.

You can use this in a view or controller as follows:

########################################### 
if current_user.is_thumbwebs_subscriber?  #
###########################################

This will return true if the current_user has a valid unexpired subscription and return false otherwise.

To limit access to controller methods add this to a controller.

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
####################################################################
before_filter :thumbwebs_subscription_required, :only =>[:show]    #
####################################################################


This will check to see if the logged_in_user has a valid unexpired subscription or it will redirect the user to a page to purchase a subscription.

This plugin should work out of the box with the restful_authenication plugin. If you do not have restful_authenciation then your user model needs to define the following methods:
   
 logged_in?  # return true if the user is logged in.
 current_user   #return the currently logged in user
